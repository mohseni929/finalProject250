March 22th (Authentication Complete)
Markus:
I worked on the following tasks:
1. <Added POST request to login page.> - This task is responsible for initializing the authentication.
2. <Added names to inputs in login page named, email and password.> - This task helps with identifying and saving the posted information.
3. <Added local strategy to authenticate users.> - This allows users to log in if their email and password matches with the saved information within the database.
4. <Added a session time.> - This task allows a log in session to transfer between pages.
5. <Modified reminder_controller> - This task allows the pages to display information based on data saved within an account.
6. <Added a function located in middleware/checkAuth, to check if session is authenticated.> - Prevents errors from occuring when clicking on "Reminder's List" when logging in.

I also needed to research on Youtube and Google the following things:
1. <http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-local/>
2. <http://www.passportjs.org/docs/authenticate/>
